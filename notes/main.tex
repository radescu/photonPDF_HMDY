\begin{abstract}
  Achieving the highest precision for theoretical predictions
  at the LHC requires the 
  calculation of hard-scattering cross-sections that include
  perturbative QCD corrections up to (N)NNLO and electroweak (EW)
  corrections up to NLO.
   %
  For consistency, parton distribution functions (PDFs) need to be
  provided with matching accuracy, which in the case of QED effects
  involves introducing the photon parton distribution of the proton,
  $x\gamma(x,Q)$.
   %
  In this work we present a determination of the photon PDF from
  fits to recent ATLAS measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan dilepton
  production at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV.
  %
  This analysis is based on the {\tt xFitter} framework,
  and has required improvements both in the {\tt APFEL} program, to account
  for NLO QED effects, and in the {\tt aMCfast} interface to account
  for the photon-initiated contributions in the EW calculations within
  {\tt MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}.
  %
  We compare our results with other recent QED fits and
  determinations of the photon PDF,
  finding in particular agreement with the LUXqed
  and the HKR calculations within uncertainties.
% for the
%  kinematical range where the ATLAS data has sensitivity to
%  $x\gamma(x,Q)$.
