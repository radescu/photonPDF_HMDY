%  Realizing the precision physics paradigm at the LHC requires the
  Achieving the highest precision physics at the LHC requires the 
  calculation of hard-scattering cross-sections which include
  perturbative QCD corrections up to (N)NNLO and electroweak
  corrections up to NLO.
   %
  For consistency, parton distribution functions (PDFs) need to be
  provided with matching accuracy, which in the case of QED effects
  involves introducing the photon parton distribution of the proton,
  $x\gamma(x,Q)$.
   %
  % Recently, there has been intense activity concerning the
  % determination of the photon PDF, based either on direct fits to
  % HERA and collider data or on theoretical calculations.
   %
  % With this motivation,
  In this work we present a novel determination of the photon PDF from
  fits to the recent ATLAS measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan
  production at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV.
  %
  The analysis is performed using the {\tt xFitter} framework which
  involves improvements both in the {\tt APFEL} program, to account
  for NLO QED effects, and in the {\tt aMCfast} interface to account
  for the photon-initiated contributions in the EW calculations within
  {\tt MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}.
  %
  We compare our results with other recent QED fits and
  determinations, finding in particular good agreement with the LUXqed
  and the HKR calculations within PDF uncertainties, in the
  kinematical range where the ATLAS DY measurement has sensitivity on
  $x\gamma(x,Q)$.
